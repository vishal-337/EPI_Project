ABSTRACT
The rise in the number of low-risk c-sections has been a concerning
health phenomenon. The goal of this project was to understand the
correlation between the rises of these rates in different parts of the
United States, by collectively looking at the chronological order in
which the rates occurred, and building a network to understand the
influence of one state’s rate on another’s. The model was calibrated
to CDC data and was used to formulate interventions that would
bring down the rates of c-sections within the healthy range. We
hypothesized that the reason for the rise of low-risk c-sections is
caused by changes in practices in guidelines in one state impacting
the behaviors of hospitals in neighboring states. We determined
that Oklahoma and California were the most influential states and
that intervening in these states did not have a large impact on other
states. This is likely due to our network being highly connected.
1 INTRODUCTION
The rate of c-section increased every year from 1996 (20.7%) to 2009
(32.9%) and has plateaued since [19]. In 2020, 31.8% of women who
gave birth in the United States did so by c-section [19] . Although csection can be lifesaving for the fetus, the mother, or both in certain
cases, the rapid increase in the rate of c-section births without
evident decreases in maternal or neonatal morbidity or mortality
raises significant concern that c-section is overused [8]. Increases
in primary c-sections in cases of “no indicated risk” have been
more rapid than in the overall population and are likely due to
changes in obstetric practice rather than changes in the medical
risk profile [12]. The US has proposed a "Healthy People 2030"
goal of reducing the national primary c-section rate to 23.6%. [16].
Further, it has been shown that an optimal c-section rate may be
closer to 15% − 19% [14]. Therefore, it is important for health care
providers and hospital systems to safely and appropriately prevent
overuse of c-section, particularly primary and low-risk c-section
[4].
The c-section rate is not homogeneous across the US, it ranged
from 22.9% in Alaska to 38.2% in Mississippi [7] in 2020. Studies
have found a 10-fold variation in the c-section rate across hospitals
in the US, and a 15-fold variation in the low-risk c-section rate
(2.4% − 36.5%) [11]. Moreover, it has been consistently found that
maternal characteristics do not fully account for the increase in

c-section rate [6, 21]. These findings suggest that other potentially
modifiable factors, such as practice variation, likely contribute to
high c-section rates [4].
We hypothesized that a contributing factor to the rise in csections can be attributed to an information and clinical practice
behavior spread between regions and through clinical guidelines,
or the lack thereof. In this project, we modeled the rising low-risk
c-section rate as an epidemic across states. We sought to understand how each state’s clinical practice influences the other state’s
practice affecting low-risk c-section rates. We will assess these influences by building a compartmental epidemiological model to
capture the interacting dynamics of the spread of a high low-risk
c-section rate. We will analyze this model to understand how different policies affect the rise of c-section in different states, and how
the influence and knowledge-spread patterns can be leveraged to
identify an optimal "intervention" that would bring the low-risk
c-section rates to a healthy range.
2 CHANGES FROM THE MILESTONE
The main feedback that was given to us during the milestone, was
that there didn’t seem to be that much of a change from the proposal
to the milestone report in terms of results. The reason for this was
that formulating a way to actually build the model took a lot longer
than we expected. Additionally, Meghan was focusing on the state
to state guidelines, while Swetha was focusing on the guideline to
state interaction. The milestone project contained a deeper analysis
of the actual data, in terms of how it can be phrased to be able to
feed into our model, and the final report contains our actual results
from our experiments.
3 LITERATURE REVIEW
3.1 Epidemiological models for social and
behavioral phenomenon
Classical epidemiological models were initially developed to map
disease progression throughout populations using simple methods
such as SIR models, or more complex methods such as agent-based
models. These models are used to analyze epidemics, typical large,
short-term outbreaks of a disease. The spread of an infectious disease is dependent on both disease related factors (infectious population, transmission, susceptibility, etc.) and social, cultural, and
geographic factors [9]. These models define a population, either
homogeneous or heterogeneous, and how mixing occurs within the
population. Finally, the spread of a disease is modeled within the
population using disease parameters. These parameters can be estimated using data or inferred from the literature, and at minimum
include the rate of infection within the population.
More recently, epidemiological models have been applied in
areas beyond infectious diseases to understand scenarios in which
a phenomenon is spreading throughout a population. Examples
of these applications include information diffusion on Twitter [3],
viral online marketing campaigns [22], social contagions such as
audience applause [13], idea adoption in academic environments
[2]. In these examples, a social and behavioral phenomenon that
spreads through a population is analyzed through a simple SIR
model to better understand how the phenomenon occurs, and to
either exploit or diminish the spread. A key difference between the
spread of diseases and ideas is that the spread of an idea is usually
an intentional act of the transmitter and/or the adopter, which may
result in slower and more heterogeneous spreading. Despite these
differences, it has been shown that simple epidemiologic models
can be effectively applied to better understand social and behavioral
phenomenon [2].
We will apply epidemiology models to the social and behavioral
phenomenon of physician behavior. Physician behavior is notoriously difficult to change, and the influence of physician behavior on
other physicians’ clinical decisions is uncertain [10]. In one study,
network methods were applied to understand how physicians influence their peers practice style in the adoption of advanced imaging
tests for women with breast cancer [20]. Leveraging these networks
of influence may lead to better adoption of technologies and higher
quality care. There is more opportunity to apply epidemiology
methods to study physician behavior and influence, and to exploit
their influence to achieve better health outcomes.
3.2 C-section rate reduction interventions
In the case of high low-risk c-section rates, there have been many
federal and local initiatives to reduce these rates to healthier ranges.
To reduce unnecessary c-sections in high income countries, there
have been financial incentives and regulatory measures introduced
for both physicians and health organizations, however the impact of
these incentives and measures is inconclusive [18]. Some interventions that have been successful in reducing unnecessary c-sections
include educating patients, using midwifes during delivery, providing feedback and evaluating physicians, and implementing guidelines [15]. A particularly successful intervention in the United States
was a quality improvement collaboration between the California
Maternal Quality Care Collaborative and Smart Care California,
WHO implemented multiple approaches to reducing c-section rates
[23]. From 2014 to 2019, the rates of low-risk c-section decreased
from 26.0% to 22.8%. This decrease was 3.2% higher than in the
rest of the United States [23]. These successful intervention methods may be more strategically implemented in states with high
influence in other states.
4 PROBLEM STATEMENT
In general, c-sections are performed in order to safeguard the health
of the mother and/or the child. However, the recent rise of unnecessary c-section without an evident reduction in maternal/neonatal
morbidity has raised a concern for the misuse or misinformed performance of c-section. We hypothesize that this rise is partially due
to information and clinical practice patterns spreading between US
states. Using epidemiological methods to model the spread of clinical practice behavior, we hope to understand these clinical practice
spread patterns between states, identify the most influential states
contributing to the rising rates, and identify optimal interventions
to reduce rates to a healthy range.
5 DATA SOURCES AND COLLECTION
We used two data sources: the CDC WONDER database and global,
national, and state clinical practice guidelines to create our epidemiology models.
The Unhealthy Rise in Unnecessary C-sections
CSE 8803 - EPI, Fall 2022, December 1, 2022,
5.1 CDC WONDER
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has created
a Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (WONDER) dataset to simplify access to public health information and
to promote information-driven decision-making. For our project,
we used the Natality online database, which reports counts of live
births occurring within the US derived from birth certificates. This
database includes counts of births that may be stratified by location,
fetal characteristics, maternal characteristics, and risk factors.
While we hoped to get birth data by the most granular geographic locality available, this locality is county data in the CDC
WONDER Natality database. However, data is only available for
counties with a population of 100,000 or more as noted in the 2000
or 2010 census. There are concerns with increasing unnecessarily
high c-section rates, especially in rural and southern regions, many
of which would be excluded if we analyzed birth data by available
counties. To pursue a more equitable analysis, we analyze c-section
rates by state, which is the next most granular geographic locality
that does not have any missing data.
Using the CDC WONDER Natality database, we retrieved counts
of live births and c-sections stratified by state and year. The Natality
data is offered in four separate online databases (1995-2002, 2003-
2006, 2007-2020, 2016-2020 (expanded)). For this analysis, counts of
c-section data are available for the years 2003 - 2020 so we limited
our analysis to these years. We combine the 2003-2006 and 2007-
2020 databases for our analysis.
Using this data, we calculated and analyzed the low-risk (LR)
c-section rates.
LR c-section Rate =
LR c-sections
LR Deliveries (1)
This rate is the target of many interventions to reduce unnecessary c-sections. A low-risk pregnant woman is defined by the US
Department of Health and Human Services as nulliparous (never
given birth before), full-term (at least 37 weeks of gestation, based
on the obstetric estimate of gestation at delivery), singleton (not
a multiple) pregnancy, with a vertex fetus (head facing in a downward position in the birth canal) [16]. Data on fetal positioning
(e.g., vertex vs. breech) is not available for 2003-2015 in the CDC
WONDER Natality data, so we define low-risk c-section as c-section
by a nulliparous, full-term, singleton (NTS) pregnant woman. Because we adjusted the definition of low-risk c-section for the data
available, we will use an increased rate of 27% as our target rate
in our model. Figure 2 shows the change in the rates of low-risk
c-sections from 2003-2020 in four regions of the United States.
Figure 2: Rate of Low-Risk C-sections by Region from 2003-
2020, retrieved from CDC WONDER Natality Database
5.2 Clinical Practice Guidelines
In 2001, Dr. Michael Robson outlined ten categories during which a
c-section would be appropriate, and these categories were validated
by the WHO [5]. The categories include (1) previous c-section has
been performed, (2) multiple gestation (twins, triplets, etc.), (3) fetal
distress, (4) fetal position, (5) preterm birth, (6) maternal infections,
etc.
While these categories take into consideration emergency situations during which a c-section is performed, more recently there
has been an increasing number of c-sections performed due to slow
labor progression rather than risk factors. Many non-emergency
c-sections may be unnecessary and actually increase the risk of
adverse outcomes for pregnant women. Table 1 shows the guidelines for non-emergency c-sections over the years, in the different
regions[1]. Gestational age is the period of time between conception
and birth, where a normal pregnancy ranges from 38 - 42 weeks.
Active labor is the minimum dilation necessary to continue with
vaginal delivery, otherwise, a c-section is performed. Finally, labor
arrest indicates the length of time in labor without progressing in
dilation.
These guidelines are potential indications of why the c-section
rate has changed over time, as is different by region. For example:
From 2012 to 2017 in the Midwest, rather than continuing to decrease the low-risk c-section rate began increasing [17]. This may
be partially due to the change in the "active labor" guideline from
5cm to 6cm dilated. This change caused women to have to labor
for longer to achieve "active labor" and likely caused many women
who were between 5-6cm to be recommended for c-sections.
6 METHODS
The goal of this project was to create a data-driven epidemiological
model to understand trends in the United States C-section rate and
to propose interventions to reduce the rate.
6.1 Phase I: Network Structure and Calibration
We modeled the US low-risk c-section rate as a network model,
where each node represented a state and the edges were directed,
weighted influence relationships. A state was considered "infected"
if it had a low-risk c-section rate above a threshold of 27%. Our
model was calibrated from the years 2002 - 2007, where we assumed that in 2002 no states were "infected". We inferred the state -

state influence edges through cascades of c-section rate changes.
This network revealed how states influence other states, and is the
baseline model for Phase II and Phase III.
To calibrate this model, we used cascade traces in the 2003 - 2007
low-risk c-section rate across states from the CDC WONDER database. Each state was represented as a node 𝑢 ∈ 𝐴𝐾, 𝐴𝐿, ...,𝑊𝑉 ,𝑊 𝑌,
and each state had a potential influence relationship, or edge, with
every other state.
(𝑢, 𝑣) ∈ (𝐴𝐾, 𝐴𝐿), (𝐴𝐾, 𝐴𝑅), ...(𝑊𝑉 ,𝑊 𝑌)
The goal of our calibration was to find the constant probability of
influence over each edge 𝑝𝑢𝑣 . To find this probability, we assume
that if state 𝑢 has a c-section rate that becomes higher than the
threshold, and the next year state 𝑣 has a c-section rate that becomes
higher than the threshold, we considered the action propagated
from state 𝑢 to 𝑣. Thus, state 𝑢 has infected state 𝑣.
We let 𝐴𝑢 be the total number of actions state 𝑢 takes, i.e. the
total number of times state 𝑢’s rate crosses the threshold. Thus,
state 𝑢 is making 𝐴𝑢 number of tries to infect node 𝑣, of which only
𝐴𝑢2𝑣 succeed. Finally, to estimate 𝑝𝑢𝑣 we compute:
𝑝
∗
𝑢𝑣 =
𝐴𝑢2𝑣
𝐴𝑢
(2)
If 𝑝𝑢𝑣 = 0, we assume a directed influence edge does not exist
from state 𝑢 to state 𝑣. If 𝑝𝑢𝑣 > 0, we assume a directed influence
edge does exist and is weighted by 𝑝𝑢𝑣 . Thus, the 𝑝𝑢𝑣 values make
up an adjacency matrix for our network.
6.2 Phase II: State Centrality
To determine which state has the most influence in c-section clinical
practice, we identified the most central node in our network. The
centrality was calculated using the package networkx, utilizing the
eigenvector centrality function
6.3 Phase III: Intervention
In the final phase, we tested whether or not implementing various
interventions in the identified central states would bring down the
overall low-risk c-section rate of the country. These interventions
practically may be similar to the California Maternal Quality Care
Collaborative intervention in California that successfully reduced
their low-risk rate by over 3%.
We tested interventions in Oklahoma and California, the two
most influential states. In our baseline model, we initialized the
model with the states that were "infectious" in 2003 and simulated
the spread of increasing and decreasing low-risk c-section rates
until 2030. In our intervention models, we similarly simulated the
spread from 2003 - 2020, but we implemented interventions in 2020
to analyze various "what-if" scenarios. Our first intervention was to
ensure that Oklahoma, our most influential (i.e. central) state, had a
low-risk c-section rate under 27% from 2020 - 2030. Thus, Oklahoma
was forced to be "uninfected" in our model after 2020. Our second
intervention was to ensure both Oklahoma and California were
"uninfected".
The goal of these interventions is to test our hypothesis that
changing the rate in one state would bring down the rates in the
other states.
7 EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS
7.1 List of Questions To Answer
With the main goal of understanding the causes of the rise in csection rates, we analyzed the following questions.
(1) Can we understand how changing one state’s c-section rates
changes another state’s c-section rates? i.e. Are the cascades
of c-section rates across states indicative of a state network
structure?
(2) Can we determine which states are most influential in this
network?
(3) Can we leverage this network to implement targeted intervention locations to "bend the curve" and bring down the
c-section rates, in line with US Healthy People Goals?
(4) Can we incorporate guidelines in the network to determine
their influence over states’ c-section rates?
Unfortunately, our semester timeline did not allow us time to
address question (4).
7.2 Experiments/Findings
7.2.1 Network Structure and Calibration. We inferred our network
from low-risk c-section cascades, and the resulting directed, weighted
network is shown in Figure 3.
The Unhealthy Rise in Unnecessary C-sections

excluded because they are disconnected from the network.
The network we inferred was dense, indicating that each state
potentially influences many states and has many influencers. This
may imply that rather than a c-section rate cascading from one
state to another, that all the states generally have similar c-section
rate changes simultaneously.
7.2.2 State Centrality. Using the eigenvector centrality function of
the networkx package, we report the centrality of the ten most central states in Figure 4. The two most central states were Oklahoma
and California, and the next five states have the same centrality
(PA, MI, NV, CT, GA). These states that were identified were used in
the next phase of the project to test various intervention schemes,
to identify if implementing an intervention in these states would
help bring down the overall c-section rates.
Figure 4: Eigenvector centrality of ten most central nodes in
influence network
Based on these results, we assume that implementing an intervention in California and Oklahoma would have the most significant
impact. However, the ten most central states all have relatively
similar centrality, which aligns with our network being highly connected. This means that there is no clearly central state that would
have vast influence compared to other states.
7.2.3 Intervention. As detailed in section 6.3, we ran two intervention models and compared them with our baseline. Our models
were run 100 times and averaged, and the results of our baseline
model and intervention are shown in Figure 5.
Figure 5: True infections, baseline model, and interventions
to reduce the number of "infected" states over time
Although the interventions we simulated do bring down the
number of "infected" states, it is only by a relatively small number
(on average less than 2). This indicates that a targeted intervention
in the most central states will only have an effect on those states and
potentially one other state. Because our network is so connected,
it would require an intervention in many more than two states to
reduce the c-section rate in all states.
7.2.4 Model Improvement and Areas of Error. One area to improve
this model is in the intervention area: Our intervention model did
perform well, and our conclusion from the result that we have is
that bringing down the rates in one state will not cascade well to the
other states. A limitation of our project is that we only considered
c-section rates as a binary, over or under 27%. An improvement to
our model would be to consider these rates as continuous variables.
In our interventions, we would want to ideally find the optimal
drop in the c-section rates that would actually cause a change in the
network. Realistically, the c-section rates will not drop drastically
from year to year, for each individual state, so the change would
have to come for a larger collective group of states. Finally, we are
limited by a relatively small timespan and our model would benefit
from having data from the 1990s.
8 FUTURE WORK AND CONCLUSION
In this project, we modeled changing c-section rates in the US as
a network model where states influenced one another. We calibrated this model to real-world data from the CDC and determined
the weighted influences each state had. We determined that Oklahoma and California were the most influential states in the network
and proposed interventions to target these states. Unfortunately,
these interventions did not have a large effect on the network. This
may indicate that physician behavior in providing unnecessary csections is not influenced by other physicians’ behavior, or that one
hospital system is not influenced by other hospital systems. A more
successful intervention may be for states to internally implement

measures to reduce their rate, or for the federal government to
implement national measures.
It is important to note that in real life, imposing these interventions is very resource intensive, and our model does not specifically
account for a trade-off between the number of interventions or size
of states vs cost or resource allocation.
Something that we hoped to achieve this semester was identifying a set of guidelines that can be implemented and simulated in
different states based on current guidelines, and test the relationship
between the guidelines themselves and the change of c-section rates.
As groundwork for this, we thoroughly scoped out the databases
provided by the CDC [? ]. However, the guideline to state is still in
progress: there is difficulty in identifying the mathematical probability from changing the guidelines to the changing of the c-section
rates, since it’s not a node to node interaction. To continue this
project forward, we would suggest to complete a similar cascading
analysis of how changing the different guidelines listed(i.e the gestational age, definition of active labor and the length of time that
determines a labor to be in labor arrest) affect the overall change
in c-section rates. In order for this project to make a real world
impact, this future study is imperative, as the work here shows
that bringing down the c-section rates in individual, influential
states does not contribute to a change significant enough to bring
the overall c-section rates to a healthy level. Hence, a more complex model understanding how the information itself is transferred
between states, and how that transfer of information affects the
c-section rates, and how to pinpoint the exact guidelines that cause
that change, is needed for a more conclusive solution.
